[env:esp32dev]
platform = espressif32
board = esp32dev
framework = arduino

; if a certain environment doesn't have 
; the necessary options, this is the DEFAULT
[env]
platform = espressif32
board = esp32dev
framework = arduino
monitor_speed = 115200
; order of operations:
; include all files, reject the main files
; then lastly, include only the main file of choice
build_src_filter = +<*> -<main*.cpp> +<main-${PIOENV}.cpp>


; here are the environment variables that
; correspond to what main file you want to flash
; to esp32 dev boards
;
; for example main-reciever.cpp corresponds to 
[env:recv]
[env:transmitter]
[env:test]
; [env:(whatever the name of the main file is)]
