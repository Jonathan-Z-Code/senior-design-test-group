## Welcome to the Senior Design Github Page! ##

Here is the current software development roadmap set by Jonathan Zurita

1. Utilize encapsulation in order to keep modules (GPS, motor control, esp-now) seperate!
2. Embrace abstraction in order to keep the setup and loop functions clean.
3. Research and implement coding standards in order to make our code easy to read and understand.

# Any and all feedback is welcome! #
